# Python to RS232 Interface for QuadTech Sentry 20 Plus / Chroma Guardian HiPot Tester

This project is an API for the Chroma (formally QuadTech) Guardian 1030 (formally Sentry 20/30 Plus) RS232 Python Interface.

Many Sentry 20 Plus units don't have the RS232, but some do. The protocol is described in the user manual for the 19071/19072/19073.
While these seem to be branded differently, they are the same unit it looks like and the interface still works OK.
